+ Pass: Change into directory "Hwk_04".

+ Pass: Check that file "proofs.md" exists.

``Problem 1``

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P1: state the base case

    Make sure to state the entire base case for the quiz. Don't just have l1 = [].

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P1: state the inductive case

    

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P1: state the inductive hypothesis

    

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P1: state the principle of induction

    

+  _3_ / _3_ : Pass: P1: first 3 steps in the base case proof are correct

    

+  _0_ / _2_ : Pass: P1: Correct use of IH in proof of inductive case

    You skipped over this step or combined it with another step.

+  _0_ / _1_ : Pass: P1: correct justification in this step using the inductive hypothesis

    

+  _3_ / _6_ : Pass: P1: first 3 steps other than IH part are correct

    Skipped over many of the steps

+ Pass: P1: Mislabeled parts?

    

``Problem 2``

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P2: state the base case

    

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P2: state the inductive case

    

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P2: state the inductive hypothesis

    

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P2: state the principle of induction

    

+  _3_ / _3_ : Pass: P2: first 3 steps in the base case proof are correct

    

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P2: Correct use of IH in proof of inductive case

    

+  _0_ / _1_ : Pass: P2: correct justification in this step using the inductive hypothesis

    Need to say you are using the IH

+  _6_ / _6_ : Pass: P2: first 3 steps other than IH part are correct

    

+ Pass: P2: Mislabeled parts?

    

``Problem 3``

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P3: state the base case

    

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P3: state the inductive case

    

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P3: state the inductive hypothesis

    

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P3: state the principle of induction

    

+  _3_ / _3_ : Pass: P3: first 3 steps in the base case proof are correct

    

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P3: Correct use of IH in proof of inductive case

    

+  _0_ / _1_ : Pass: P3: correct justification in this step using the inductive hypothesis

    

+  _5_ / _6_ : Pass: P3: first 3 steps other than IH part are correct

    You should use IH here to turn one side into the other.

+ Pass: P3: Mislabeled parts?

    

``Problem 4``

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P4: state the base case

    

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P4: state the inductive case

    

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P4: state the inductive hypothesis

    

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P4: state the principle of induction

    

+  _3_ / _3_ : Pass: P4: first 3 steps in the base case proof are correct

    

+  _0_ / _2_ : Pass: P4: Correct use of IH in proof of inductive case

    I don't see where you use IH. product t = prod (to_list t). You seem to be dropping the to_list

+  _0_ / _1_ : Pass: P4: correct justification in this step using the inductive hypothesis

    

+  _4_ / _6_ : Pass: P4: first 3 steps other than IH part are correct

    You seem to be skipping over steps. You need to go line by line. One line directly evaluates to the next.

+ Pass: P4: Mislabeled parts?

    

``Problem 5``

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P5: state the base case

    

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P5: state the inductive case

    

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P5: state the inductive hypothesis

    

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P5: state the principle of induction

    

+  _3_ / _3_ : Pass: P5: first 3 steps in the base case proof are correct

    

+  _2_ / _2_ : Pass: P5: Correct use of IH in proof of inductive case

    

+  _0_ / _1_ : Pass: P5: correct justification in this step using the inductive hypothesis

    Explicitly mention when you are using IH

+  _6_ / _6_ : Pass: P5: first 3 steps other than IH part are correct

    

+ Pass: P5: Mislabeled parts?
